  <h3>What is a HTML freewrite?</h3>
  <p>
    We will be writing vanilla HTML, CSS, and maybe a little JavaScript
    together. The idea is pretty loose and self-directed. Come to the
    freewrite with a project in mind or just write in the moment.
  </p>
  <h3>How much HTML should I know?</h3>
  <p>
    It’s really up to you. It’s completely okay to use the freewrite to
    learn HTML if you are just starting out. If you get stuck you can try to
    ask other Hack Clubbers for help.
  </p>
  <h3>Are frameworks/libraries allowed?</h3>
  <p>
    There’s nothing stopping you from using a framework but think of this as
    a time to get use the foundational languages that made the web great to
    begin with. The intention of the free write is to write, discuss, and
    share some of our documents/web pages on the www.
  </p>

  <h3>
    I write too much HTML already. Is there anything else I can do during
    the freewrite?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Why not teach someone HTML. If more people learned how to self publish
    on the web, we wouldn’t need many of the big platforms that people
    depend on to participate in the web today.
